### FAQ

1. What is my portfolio about?

My portfolio is about my photography/videography business as well as a blog page where I post my own work. I added my brother as a co-owner and a projects page where I post my monthly recaps; these projects are collages of what I did during the month, I added a small part of it but there is more within the images folder. I like the colour pink so I made that the main colour of the site, my ux-ui teacher didn't like the grey and green colour I had so I didn't add them here.

2. What problems did I have when making the site?

One problem I had was trying to make it look identical to the figma file, I know that the whole point of the assignment but I am still a begginer when it comes to coding so I had to tweak some things abit. I also had trouble using the css file so I just skipped that part, I wanted to use the papercss one but whenever I tried editing it within the site it wouldn't work so I just did my own even though I know thats not what you're looking for.

3. What have I learned while making the site?

I learned about the importance of targeting and classes, I had fun with the class tags because it felt like a puzzle and I was putting the right pieces together. I also learned how to make images round, it wasn't working for me at first but I was able to figure it out and I think it looks better rounded than having sharp corners throughout the site. 

4. What do I wish to learn/add within the site?

I definatly want to learn how to add/use css frameworks within the site so my pages can look more clean/professional. I would also like to add a page for each project and go into detail as well as create a page that focuses on the services I can provide for potential clients.
